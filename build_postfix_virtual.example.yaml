# In this example "john.example.com" is a domain that John uses to create unique
# email addresses for each web site he creates an account at. For example John
# uses the email address facebook.com@john.example.com when he signs up for a
# facebook account and twitter.com@john.example.com when he signs up for a
# twitter account. "john.doe@example.edu" is John's actual email address that he
# wants all of his facebook and twitter notifications delivered to. The
# "blocked_domains" list is a list of sites where john has created an account
# and the site subsequently sold his email address to marketers, was hacked or
# published his email address publicly on the internet. As a result spam email
# is now routinely sent to those email addresses and John wants to block them.
# In this example John signed up for an account at southernrailway.com using the
# email address "southernrailway.com@john.example.com". southernrailway.com
# subsequently sold his email address to marketers and spam is now being sent to
# that address. By including it in the "blocked_domains" list, those emails will
# be rejected.
